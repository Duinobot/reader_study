I've successfully implemented authentication using fastapi-users in your FastAPI backend project. Here's a summary of what's been set up:

Authentication System Overview
User Model and Database:

Created a User model that extends SQLAlchemyBaseUserTable with your specific fields (role, experience, etc.)
Set up async SQLite database support with aiosqlite (successfully installed)
Authentication Components:

JWT-based authentication with a 30-day token lifetime
Password hashing (handled by fastapi-users)
Role support via the role_id field
Auth Endpoints:

/auth/jwt/login - For user login
/auth/register - For creating new accounts
/auth/me - To get the current user's profile
Also includes password reset and account verification routes
Protected Routes:

Provided dependency functions (current_active_user, current_superuser) for securing routes
Project Structure
How to Use in Your Routes
To protect an API route, you can now use the current user dependency:

For superuser-only routes:

Important Notes
In production, replace the hardcoded SECRET in manager.py with a secure environment variable.
The database has been switched to use asynchronous operations, which is required by fastapi-users.
The project log has been updated to include these auth implementation details.
Your authentication system is ready for testing. You can register users, log in to get a JWT token, and use that token to access protected resources.
