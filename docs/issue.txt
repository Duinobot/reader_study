# Authentication Implementation and Testing Issues (May 2025)

I've successfully implemented authentication using fastapi-users in your FastAPI backend project. Here's a summary of what's been set up:

## Authentication System Overview
User Model and Database:

- Created a User model that extends SQLAlchemyBaseUserTable with your specific fields (role, experience, etc.)
- Set up async SQLite database support with aiosqlite (successfully installed)

Authentication Components:

- JWT-based authentication with a 30-day token lifetime
- Password hashing (handled by fastapi-users)
- Role support via the role_id field

Auth Endpoints:

- /auth/jwt/login - For user login
- /auth/register - For creating new accounts
- /auth/me - To get the current user's profile
- Also includes password reset and account verification routes

Protected Routes:

- Provided dependency functions (current_active_user, current_superuser) for securing routes

## Test Suite Fixes

We identified and resolved multiple issues in the test suite:

1. **Authentication Dependency Chain Issue**
   
   **Problem**: The authentication dependency wasn't correctly enforced in tests when using the nested dependency chain.
   
   **Original Code**:
   ```python
   # In deps.py
   def get_current_user():
       return current_active_user
   
   # In endpoint file
   current_user = Depends(deps.get_current_user)
   ```

   **Fix**:
   ```python
   # In endpoint file
   from app.auth.manager import current_active_user
   from app.auth.models import User
   
   current_user: User = Depends(current_active_user)
   ```

   Always directly import and use the authentication dependency from the auth manager.

2. **CRUD Operations Access Pattern**
   
   **Problem**: Code was using attribute notation but CRUD modules export dictionaries.
   
   **Original Code**:
   ```python
   crud.case.get(db=db, case_id=case_id)
   ```
   
   **Fix**:
   ```python
   crud.case["get"](db=db, case_id=case_id)
   ```

3. **API Endpoint Path Prefixes**
   
   **Problem**: Tests were using `/api/v1/` prefix but actual routes didn't use it.
   
   **Original Test**:
   ```python
   response = await client.get("/api/v1/cases/1")
   ```

   **Fixed Test**:
   ```python
   response = await client.get("/cases/1")
   ```

4. **Unique Test Data Generation**
   
   **Problem**: Tests using hardcoded entity names caused conflicts on repeated runs.
   
   **Fix**:
   ```python
   import time
   unique_name = f"Test Diagnosis Term {time.time()}"
   ```

5. **Schema Validation for Required Fields**
   
   **Problem**: Some fields that should be required were marked as optional.
   
   **Original Schema**:
   ```python
   class CaseCreate(CaseBase):
       ground_truth_diagnosis_id: Optional[int] = None
   ```
   
   **Fixed Schema**:
   ```python
   class CaseCreate(CaseBase):
       ground_truth_diagnosis_id: int  # Required field
   ```

## Important Implementation Notes

In production, replace the hardcoded SECRET in manager.py with a secure environment variable.
The database has been switched to use asynchronous operations, which is required by fastapi-users.
The project log has been updated to include these auth implementation details.

## Future Development Guidelines

1. **Authentication Dependencies**: 
   - Always use direct imports from `app.auth.manager` instead of indirect dependencies
   - Example: `from app.auth.manager import current_active_user` 

2. **Testing Authenticated Endpoints**:
   - Ensure all authentication tests validate both success with valid token and failure without token
   - Use unique data with timestamps for all test entity creation
   - Confirm that endpoint handler functions properly type their parameters

3. **CRUD Operations**:
   - Use dictionary syntax consistently: `crud.module["function"]`
   - Validate entity existence before create/update operations
   - Add proper error handling for all database operations

4. **API Path Structure**:
   - Be consistent with URL path structure
   - If changing URL structure, update all tests accordingly
